<!-- 1.the first I will do is to chnage H1 into a row counter eg  h1>Row counter/h1> 
2. now around my existing HTML i am going to add a DIV with a class of cantainer. the reason im doing this is to keep the buttoms from strching out too much and also because im going to add a pretty loud background and I wanna make sure that the text still remain easy to read
3. I am going to change the image use bunches of wool
4. the font that I am going to use is open sans so i am going to remove everthing before it.

look here the image is repeating so Im going to add a height of 100vh. is basically  just so that the background image will take up a 100% of whatever the current height of the window is

// now i will add some style to container class, im going to make a background white , add a MAX WIDTH OF 80%, so that the container will take no more than 80% of the current window width

// now I will do a margin auto so that it stays centered eg  margin: auto; finally I am going to add a 3px solid border and a border radius of 10px

// now im going to add a small border around both of the btns. Im also going to change the color of the btns to something vibrant to match the loud background

// and lastly I will target this "previous enties text" to make it a lilte bit bolder, now this looks all good to me eg #save-el {
    font-weight: bold; now lets start deploying

    //DEPLOYMENT- the first thing is to start downloading the code from scrimba to your computer. here is a quick reminder- so click on settings, the download zip, now the file s are on your computer

    // after that go ahead and unzip it. also make sure you delete any files you see in the unzip folder that aren't the files that you see in your folder directory, that is the files that you did not create.
    you might see a file called for example packet json, or config.js make sure you delte this files beofre you attempt to deploy or may run into problems
